  * `push image` (we don't track the image name or the location)
  * `remove image`
  * `show logs`
  * `start container`, `start container interactive`
  * `start Azure CLI` container
  * `stop container`
  * `system prune`
  * `tag` (we don't track tag name)
  * Configure workspace along with the type (e.g. Node or Other)

> Please note, you can turn off telemetry reporting for VS Code and all extensions through the ["telemetry.enableTelemetry": false setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
