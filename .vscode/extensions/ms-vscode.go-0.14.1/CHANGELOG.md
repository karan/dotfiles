    [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve). [Feature Request 1599](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1599) implemented with [PR 2125](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/2125).

    Please note the feature of attaching to a local process using process id only works when the process is started by running the compiled code i.e the executable and not by using the command `go run`. This is a limitation from delve.

## 0.6.66 - 2nd October, 2017

### [Multi Root support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_15#_preview-multi-root-workspaces) when using [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)

We now have [Multi Root support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_15#_preview-multi-root-workspaces) for Go. [PR 1221](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1221) Please note:
* The settings at Folder level takes precedence over the ones at the Workspace level which in turn take precedence over the ones at the User level
* You can have the different roots in the multi-root mode use different GOPATHs. The experimental language server feature is not supported in such cases though.
* All current Go related features that refer to "workspace" will refer to the individual roots in the multi root mode. For example: Build/lint/vet/test workspace or `Go to Symbol in workspace`.
* Give it a try and log any issues that you find in the [vscode-go repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues)

### Auto-completion improvements

* [Nuruddin Ashr (@uudashr)](https://github.com/uudashr)
    * Auto-completion for unimported packages that are newly installed/built will now show up without the need for reloading VS Code.
    * Completions from sub vendor packages that were showing up are ignored now. Fixes [Bug 1251](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1251)
    * The `package` snippet completion is now smarter when suggesting package names. [PR 1220](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1220). It suggests
        * `main` when current file is `main.go` or there exists a `main.go` file in current folder
        * The folder name when the current file is `internal_test.go`
        * The folder name with `_test` when current file is a test file
        * If the folder name in above cases has `-` or `.`, then what appears after the `-` or `.` is suggested.
* [Alexander Kohler (@alexkohler)](https://github.com/alexkohler)
    * A new setting `go.useCodeSnippetsOnFunctionSuggestWithoutType` is introduced. This allows completions of functions with their parameter signature but without the parameter types. [Feature Request 1241](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1241)
* [Miklós @kmikiy](https://github.com/kmikiy)
    * 3 New snippets for the `Log` methods from the `testing` package

* [Katsuma Ito (@ka2n)](https://github.com/ka2n)
    * The Debug Test codelens now uses the buildTags and buildFlags correctly. [PR 1248](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1248)
* [Chase Adams (@chaseadamsio)](https://github.com/chaseadamsio)
    * You can now run tests from unsaved files. Fixes [Bug 1225](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1225)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Changes done to coverage options and decorators in settings now apply immediately without the need for moving to another file and back. Fixes [Bug 1171](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1171)
    * The Run Test and Debug Test codelens react to change in the codelens setting immediately without the need for moving to another file and back. Fixes [Bug 1172](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1172)
    * `$workspaceRoot` will now be resolved when part of `go.testEnvVars` and `go.toolsEnvVars` setting.


### Improvements around Packages
* [Nuruddin Ashr (@uudashr)](https://github.com/uudashr)
    * `Go: Browse Packages` command will now include newly installed/built packages without the need for reloading VS Code.
* [Hugo (@juicemia)](https://github.com/juicemia)

## 0.6.65 - 6th September, 2017

[Seonggi Yang (@sgyang)](https://github.com/sgyang)
* [Bug [#1152](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1152)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1152): Auto completions for unimported packages do not work anymore on certain machines. [PR 1197](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1197)

[Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
* [Bug [#1194](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1194)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1194) and [Bug [#1196](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1196)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1196): Debugger doesnt use GOPATH from env in debug configuration
* Go to implementation cmd doesnt show up when using the language server.

## 0.6.64 - 5th September, 2017

* [Dan Mace (@ironcladlou)](https://github.com/ironcladlou), [Vincent Chinedu Okonkwo (@codmajik)](https://github.com/codmajik) & [Dima (@hummerd)](https://github.com/hummerd)
    * Support for the `Go To Implementation` command on interfaces. [Feature Request [#771](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/771)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/771).
* [Craig-Stone (@Craig-Stone)](https://github.com/Craig-Stone)

* [Nuruddin Ashr (@uudashr)](https://github.com/uudashr)
    * Refactor the way test output is shown to show output of `log.Println`. Fixes [Issue [#1120](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1120)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1120) with [PR 1124](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1124)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Test Improvements
        * Show test coverage after the command `Go: Test Package` is run. You can disable this by setting `go.coverOnTestPackage` to `false`.
        * Show test coverage even if files are outside of GOPATH. Fixes [Issue [#1122](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1122)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1122)
        * Decouple running test coverage on save from running build/lint/test on save. Fixes the issue where the problems view was not getting updated until `go.coverOnSave` was disabled.
    * Debugging Improvements
        * No need to set GOPATH in debug configuration in the `launch.json` file anymore. When no GOPATH is provided this way, the debug adapter will now infer the GOPATH based on the path of the file/package being debugged. This fixes [Issue [#840](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/840)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/840).
        * The debug code lens will now honor the `go.buildFlags`, `go.buildTags` and `go.testFlags` settings. Fixes [Issue [#1117](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1117)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1117)

Fixes [Issue [#899](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/899)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/899) and [Issue [#1096](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1096)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1096).
        * `gometalinter` and `dlv` will honor the `go.toolsGopath` setting. Fixes [Issue [#1110](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1110)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1110)
        * Skip vendor folders from lint and vet results.

## 0.6.63 - 26th July, 2017

### Features

* [Ian Chiles (@fortytw2)](https://github.com/fortytw2)
    * Option to use [megacheck](https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/tree/master/cmd/megacheck) as a linting tool which
can have significantly better performance than `gometalinter`, while only supporting a subset of the tools. Use the setting `go.lintTool` to try this.
* [alexandrevez (@alexandrevez)](https://github.com/alexandrevez)
    * Option to highlight gutters rather than full text for code coverage. Use the new setting `go.coverageDecorator` to try this.
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a) & [Marwan Sulaiman (@marwan-at-work)](https://github.com/marwan-at-work)
    * Browse packages and go files with new command `Go: Browse Packages`. [Feature Request 330](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/330)
         - If cursor is on an import statement, then files from the imported package will be shown in the quick pick control
         - Else, all packages are shown in the quick pick control. Select any and corresponding Go files will be shown next.
         - Selecting any of the Go files, will open the file in a new editor.
* [Saud Khan (@bidrohi)](https://github.com/bidrohi)
    * Print import paths of Go tools as they get installed. [PR 1032](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1032)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Prompt to update dependent Go tools when there is a change in the Go version. [Feature Request 797](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/797)
    * Better user experience when dependent Go tools are missing. [Feature Request 998](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/998)
         - Prompts will only show up for tools that are used for features that are explicitly executed by the user. Eg: Rename, Generate Unit Tests, Modify tags. And not for features that get triggered behind the scenes like linting, hover or format on save.
         - When the prompts do show up, closing them will ensure that they wont show up for the duration of the current session of VS Code.

    * `Go: Generate Interface Stubs` should work when interface is prefixed with package path


## 0.6.62 - 9th June, 2017

### Features
* [Jamie Stackhouse (@itsjamie)](https://github.com/itsjamie)
   * New command `Go: Generate interface stub` to generate stubs that implement given interface using [impl](https://github.com/josharian/impl). [PR 939](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/939)
        - When the command is run, you are prompted to provide interface name. Eg: `f *File io.Closer`
        - The stubs are then generated where the cursor is in the editor.
* [Guilherme Oenning (@goenning)](https://github.com/goenning)
    * New setting `go.testEnvFile` to configure the location of a file that would have environment variables to use while running tests. [PR 971](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/971)
        - File contents should be of the form `key=value`.
        - Values from the existing setting `go.test.EnvVars` will override the above
        - These environment variables will also be used by the "Debug Test" codelens
        - When debugging using the debug viewlet or pressing `F5`, the above will not be used. Continue to use the `env` and/or `envFile` property in the debug configurations in the `launch.json` file.
* [Ole (@vapourismo)](https://github.com/vapourismo)
    * You can now run build/lint/vet on the whole workspace instead of just the current package on file save. [PR 1023](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1023)
        - To enable this, the settings `go.buildOnSave`, `go.lintOnSave` and `go.vetOnSave` now take values `package`, `workspace` or `off` instead of the previous `true`/`false`.
        - These features are backward compatible and so if you are still using `true`/`false` for these settings, they will work as they did before, but you will get a warning in your settings file.
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Better build performance when working on main packages and test files by using the `-i` flag.
    * Better linting experience while running `gometalinter` by using the `--aggregate` flag which aggregates similar errors from multiple linters.

    * Fix for [Bug 964](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/964) The setting `go.referencesCodeLens.enabled` is deprecated in favor of `go.enableCodeLens` to control multiple types of codelens.
        ```json
        "go.enableCodeLens": {
            "references": false,
            "runtest": true
        }

    * Fix for [Bug 947](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/947) Mac users using the latest delve from master may see that all env variables are empty while debugging their code. This is due to delve using the `--backend=lldb` option in Mac by default. You can now change this default value by setting the `backend` property to `native` in the `launch.json` file. [Commit 4beecf1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/commit/4beecf1db2aaa18b336be2ee64476b56202fc959).

         * `Go: Add Tags` command adds tags configured in `go.addTags` setting to selected struct fields. By default, `json` tags are added. Examples:
             * To add `xml` tags, set `go.addTags` to `{"tags": "xml"}`
             * To add `xml` with `cdata` option, set `go.addTags` to `{"tags": "xml", "options": "xml=cdata"}`
             * To add both `json` and `xml` tags, set `go.addTags` to `{"tags": "json,xml"}`
         * `Go: Remove Tags` command removes tags configured in `go.removeTags` setting from selected struct fields.
             * By default, all tags are removed.
             * To remove only say `xml` tags, set `go.removeTags` to `{"tags": "xml"}`
         * To be prompted for tags instead of using the configured ones, set `go.addTags` and/or `go.removeTags` to `{"promptForTags": true}`
    * Fix rename issue when `diff` tool from Git or Cygwin are in the `PATH` in Windows. [PR 866](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/866)

    * Suggestion items to import packages disabled in single line import statements and the line with package definition where they do not make sense. [PR 860](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/860)

### Debugging improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Support to build and run your Go file.  [PR 881](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/881)
        * Press `Ctrl+F5` or run the command `Debug: Start Without Debugging` to run using the currently selected launch configuration.
        * If you don't have a `launch.json` file, then the current file will be run.
        * Supported only for launch configs with `type` as `debug` and `program` that points to a Go file and not package
    * New `envFile` attribute in `launch.json` where you can provide a file with env variables to use while debugging. [PR 849](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/849)
    * Use current file's directory instead of folder opened in VS Code to debug in the default configurations. [Commit 0915e50a](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/commit/0915e50a1ada5c74742d9c4ce7f265b5e273ca31)

### Tooling improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * New Setting `go.languageServerFlags` that will be passed while running the Go language server. [PR 882](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/882)
        * Set this to `["trace"]` to see the traces from the language server in the output pane under the channel "go-langserver"
        * Set this to `["trace", "logfile", "path to a text file to log the trace]` to log the traces and errors from the language server to a file.
    * `Go: Install Tools` command now installs delve as well in Linux and Windows, but not in Mac OSX. [Commit 30ea096](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/commit/30ea0960d6f773cc2e8e18ba5113960d1f5faf08) Fixes [Bug 874](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/874)
* [netroby @netroby](https://github.com/netroby)
    * `Go: Install Tools` command now installs `godoc`. [PR 854](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/854)

### Others
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Use `GOPATH` as defined by the `go env` output as default. Use `go` binary from default platform specific locations when GOROOT is not set as env variable. Fixes [Bug 873](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/873)
    * Fix compiling errors for vendor packages in case of symlinks. [PR 864](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/864)

    * Experimental new setting `go.editorContextMenuCommands` to control which commands show up in the editor context menu.
* [Albert Callarisa (@acroca)](https://github.com/acroca) and [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * New setting `go.gotoSymbol.ignoreFolders` that allows to ignore folders while using the "Go to Symbol in Workspace" feature. This takes in an array of folder names (not paths). Best used to ignore vendor folders while doing a workspace symbol search. [PR 795](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/795)

## 0.6.55 - 3rd March, 2017
* Re-publishing the extension from a non Windows machine as the fix for [Bug 438](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/438) worked only on Windows machines.
For details read the discussion in [PR 838](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/838).

## 0.6.54 - 28th February, 2017

### Tooling improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a) and [Sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver)
    * A new setting `go.useLanguageServer` to use the Go language server from [Sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver) for features like Hover, Definition, Find All References, Signature Help, Go to Symbol in File and Workspace. [PR 750](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/750)
        * This is an experimental feature and is not available in Windows yet.
        * If set to true, you will be prompted to install the Go language server. Once installed, you will have to reload VS Code window.
        The language server will then be run by the Go extension in the background to provide services needed for the above mentioned features.

### GOPATH improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Fix for [Bug 623](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/623). `${workspaceRoot}` and `~` are now supported in `go.gopath` and `go.toolsGopath` settings. [PR 768](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/768)
    * The default GOPATH used by Go 1.8 when none is set as environment variable is now supported by the extension as well. [PR 820](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/820)
* [Vincent Chinedu Okonkwo (@codmajik)](https://github.com/codmajik)
    * Added new setting `go.inferGopath`. When `true` GOPATH will be inferred from the path of the folder opened in VS Code.
    This will override the value from `go.gopath` setting as well as the GOPATH environment variable. [PR 762](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/762)

### Debugging improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Debug current file without a launch configuration file. Simply press `F5` to start the debug session.
    A `launch.json` is still required to debug tests or for advanced debug configurations. [PR 769](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/769)
    * Launch configuration snippets are now available for common scenarios like debugging file/package or debugging a test package/function.
    These snippets can be used through IntelliSense when editing the `launch.json` file. [PR 794](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/794)
    * Fix for [Bug 492](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/492). Now when there are build errors, starting a debug session will display the error instead of hanging. [PR 774](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/774)
* [Rob Lourens (@roblourens)](https://github.com/roblourens)
    * Fix for [Bug 438](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/438). Now when you stop a debug session, all processes started by the session will be closed as well. [PR 765](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/765)
* [Suraj Barkale (@surajbarkale-dolby)](https://github.com/surajbarkale-dolby)
    * Fix for [Bug 782](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/782). Helpful error messages when the `program` attribute in `launch.json` file is invalid or not a full path. [PR 790](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/790)
* [F0zi (@f0zi)](https://github.com/f0zi)
    * Fix for [Bug 689](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/689). When debugging against a remote machine, paths anywhere under the GOPATH will be correctly mapped so you can set breakpoints in them.
    Previously only paths next to the program could be debugged. [PR 742](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/742)

### Testing improvements
* [Oleg Bulatov (@dmage)](https://github.com/dmage)
    * Added new setting `go.testOnSave`. When `true`, all tests in the current package will be run on saving a Go file.
    The status of the tests will be shown in the status bar at the bottom of the VS Code window. It is not advised to have this on when you have Auto Save enabled. [PR 810](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/810)
* [Jeff Willette (@deltaskelta)](https://github.com/deltaskelta)
    * Test output is no longer verbose by default. Add `-v` to the `go.testFlags` to get verbose output. [PR 817](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/817)

### Other Bug Fixes
* [Richard Musiol (@neelance)](https://github.com/neelance)
    * Fix offset for files with multibyte characters so that features like Hover and Go To Definition work as expected. [PR 780](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/780)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Fix for [Bug 777](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/777) Less disruptive experience during test failures when `go.coveronSave` is `true`.
    * Fix for [Bug 680](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/680) Reduce noise in Go to Symbol in File feature by removing the entries corresponding to import statements. [PR 775](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/775)


## 0.6.53 - 30th January, 2017

### Installation improvements
* [Sam Herrmann (@samherrmann)](https://github.com/samherrmann), [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    *  A new setting `go.toolsGopath` for providing an alternate location to install all the Go tools that the extension depends on, if you don't want them cluttering your GOPATH. [PR 351](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/351) and [PR 737](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/737).
        * This is useful when you work on different GOPATHs.
        * Remember to run `Go: Install Tools` command to install the tools to the new location.
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * All the "Install tool" options (the pop ups you see) and the `Go: Install Tools` command now support `gometalinter` if it is your chosen linting tool. [PR 735](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/735).
        * Since `gometalinter` internally installs linters and expects them to be in the user's GOPATH, `gometalinter` will get installed to your GOPATH and not the alternate location specified in `go.toolsGopath`

### Build improvements
* [Matt Aimonetti (@mattetti)](https://github.com/mattetti)
    * While building, we now use the `-i` flag (for non main packages) which installs dependent packages, which in turn get used in subsequent builds resulting in faster builds in bigger workspaces. [PR 718](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/718)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Build errors with no line numbers (for eg. Import cycle) are now displayed in the output window and will be mapped to the first line of the file. [PR 740](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/740)

### Test improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * A new setting `go.testFlags` that can be used to run tests. If null, `go.buildFlags` will be used. [PR 482](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/482)
    * Customize flags for each of the test command by using different keybindings. [PR 482](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/482). In the below example, `ctrl+shift+t` is bound to run the tests in current file with `-short` flag. The commands here can be `go.test.package`, `go.test.file` or `go.test.cursor`.

        ```json
        {
            "key": "ctrl+shift+t",
            "command": "go.test.file",
            "args": {
                "flags": ["-short"]
            },
            "when": "editorTextFocus"
        }
        ```
    * New toggle command `Go: Toggle Test File` that lets you toggle between your Go file and the corresponding test file. Previous commands `Go: Open Test File` and `Go: Open Implementation For Test File` have been deprecated in favor of this new command. [PR 739](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/739). You can add a keyboard binding to this as below:

        ```json
        {
            "key": "ctrl+shift+t",
            "command": "go.toggle.test.file",
            "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'go'"
        }
        ```
    * If current file is not a test file, show error message while running test commands, instead of displaying success message. Fixes [#303](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/303)
* [Marcel Voigt (@nochso)](https://github.com/nochso)
   * Show error message in output window when running test coverage fails. [PR 721](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/721)

### Debugging improvements
* [Andreas Kuhn (@ankon)](https://github.com/ankon)
   * Honor the `cwd` launch configuration argument. [PR 714](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/714)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
   * GOPATH set in the `env` property in `launch.json` will also be used to find `dlv` tool. [PR 725](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/725).
* [Rob Lourens (@roblourens)](https://github.com/roblourens)
   * New property `trace` in `launch.json` to provide option to have verbose logging while debugging using vscode-debug-logger. [PR 753](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/753). This will help in diagnosing issues with debugging in the Go extension.
